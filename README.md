## About the Game

In this game you are expected to collect more stars as you can. You'll be given 10 points for every collected stars. When you collect all stars in the screen, new stars will appear and one bomb will be added. Every time you collect whole stars, more and more bombs joins to the game. The game ends when bombs hit the player.

Gameplay is extremely simple. To move around use arrow keys (" ↑ " - Jump, " → " - Move right, " ← " - Move left) as usual. Try to get as much point as you can, before the any bomb welcomes you)))

Good Luck!
